goal: allow inconsistent levels of indent later in an outline

priority:  low.  finish hiena mapping system first.  use ox3 as a test util.

example:  the outline nests 3 layers in, and then steps out in smaller indent sizes for 5 layers.

solution: use btree to keep indent stack

solution: array elements are altered to match the new indent size after an END_BODY


2017-9-6  DONE

write ox3: same as ox2 but no mapping calls

goal: debug ox parser

note: mapping calls caused a double-free err.
