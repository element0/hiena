todo:  how to associate fragment info with a mapcel (see mapcel.md)



2017-10-4  0625

todo:  read bytes from a mapcel.

how:  use a dcel to encapsulate the mapcel target.

why:  a mapcel doesn't contain media information, a fragment does.

done: use a directory builder stack in dcel_fh for dcel_mapsvc functions


2017-9-26  1844

fixed: mapcel_dir object

    implements an array of mapcel pointers that reallocate in blocks when more elements are added.


2017-9-7 1800

goal: fix mapping system and API.

status:
    9-21 working on dcel_dir_svc
    9-21 working on mapsvc/{new_dirent,make_dir}

goal: allow inconsistent levels of indent later in an outline

priority:  low.  finish hiena mapping system first.  use ox3 as a test util.

example:  the outline nests 3 layers in, and then steps out in smaller indent sizes for 5 layers.

solution: use btree to keep indent stack

solution: array elements are altered to match the new indent size after an END_BODY


2017-9-6  DONE

write ox3: same as ox2 but no mapping calls

goal: debug ox parser

note: mapping calls caused a double-free err.
 

2017-8-3

add hash function internal to mapsvc to hash strings into rule ids.

pass mapsvc a string typecast as void *

keep ruleid void * compatible

working in:
  btree
  mapsvc
  .l .y
  mapcel
