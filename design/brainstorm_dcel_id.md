id
--

an id is a key which distinguishes one object from any other object.

in the case of fungeable objects, ordinal identifiers suffice.

in the case of uniquly differentiated objects, one or more characteristics may be needed.

with those two it should be possible to analyze patterns of both fungeable and non-fungeable dcels.
