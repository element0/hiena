instruction queue
-----------------

without considering conditional execution, a grid computer controller can have an instruction queue.

at its most simple form an instruction queue is processed in order from beginning to end.



conditional execution
---------------------

in a pipeline, each instruction is contingent on its prior.

if-then-else statements.

switch-case statements.

breaks, returns

branches, jumps

stack frames, registers




example grid instruction queue:  fudge language
-----------------------------------------------

fudge:

        file:///path/file.ox.dir/subob.ox.divine.html

queue:

        1 begin
        2 source "file" "path"
        3 if 2 then continue; else end
        4 map 2 "dir"
        5 if 4 then continue; else end
        6 findchild 2 "file"
        7 if 6 then continue; else end
        8 map 6 "ox"
        9 if 8 then jump TBD

        10 transcode 6 "ox"
        11 if 10 then continue; else end
        12 map 10 "dir"
        13
